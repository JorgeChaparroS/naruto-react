This is my first NextJs project. Sorry for bad practices LOL, I'm just learning a new technology. 

To run the project locally, after clonning it, just run the next commands: 

1. npm i (make sure to have installed in your pc Node)
2. npm run dev

If you do not want to run the project locally, you can always go on https://naruto-wiki-jorgechaparros-dev-react.netlify.app/

That's it. Enjoy!
